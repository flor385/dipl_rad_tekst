### Master's thesis, Florijan StamenkoviÄ‡, Faculty of electical engineering and computing, Zagreb
### June 2015.



This repository consists of the Latex formatted master's thesis in which multiple language modeling techiques are explored. Those are:
- Knesser-Ney smoothed n-gram models
- neural network models
- log-bilinear language models (Mnih, Hinton, 2008.)

The thesis is written in Croatian. The actual models are contained in another repository:
