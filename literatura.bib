  abstract = {{Computational properties of use of biological organisms or to the construction of computers can emerge as collective properties of systems having a large number of simple equivalent components (or neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.}},

@TechReport {mrscc,
abstract     = {<p>Work on modeling semantics in text is progressing quickly, yet there are few
                existing public datasets which authors can use to measure and compare their
                systems. This work takes a step towards addressing this issue. We present the MSR
                Sentence Completion Challenge Data, which consists of 1,040 sentences, each of
                which has four impostor sentences, in which a single (fixed) word in the original
                sentence has been replaced by an impostor word with similar occurrence
                statistics. For each sentence the task is then to determine which of the five
                choices for that word is the correct one. This data was constructed from Project
                Gutenberg data. Seed sentences were selected from Sherlock Holmes novels, and
                then imposter words were suggested with the aid of a language model trained on
                over 500 19th century novels. The language model was used to compute 30
                alternative words for a given low frequency word in a sentence, and human judges
                then picked the 4 best impostor words, based on a set of provided guidelines.
                Although the data presented here will not be changed, this is still a work in
                progress, and we plan to add similar datasets based on other sources. This
                technical report is a living document and will be updated appropriately as new
                datasets are constructed and new results on existing datasets (for example, using
                human subjects) are reported.</p>},
